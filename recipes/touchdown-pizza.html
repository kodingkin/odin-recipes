    <p>My favorite sports pub serves this, and I've come up with a simple and delicious home version. Many local restaurants sell wing sauce, and most grocery stores carry it near the steak and BBQ sauces. It's rich, so serve in squares as an appetizer. Serve ranch dressing, celery, and carrot sticks on the side. Enjoy!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><Strong>Prebaked pizza crust</Strong></li>
        <li><strong>Diced cooked chicken breast</strong></li>
        <li><Strong>Buffalo wing sauce</Strong></li>
        <li><Strong>Package crumbled blue cheese</Strong></li>
        <li><Strong>Celery, thinly sliced</Strong></li>
        <li><Strong>Shredded mozzarella cheese</Strong></li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Place pizza crust on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
